= Meme Organizer 3000

= What does it do
The script scans your root directory for a file named tree-cert.txt, and if it doesn't find it, 
it creates a meticulously organized file tree structure in that directory. Say goodbye to the frustration of manual
file organization and hello to effortless, organized productivity.
